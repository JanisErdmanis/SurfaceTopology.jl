Not always it is clear which datastructure would be most performant for a numerical algorithm so it is wise to write a datastructure generic code. This package is exactly for that purpose for orriented closed surfaces.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Intorduction","title":"Intorduction","text":"The simplest representation of triangular mesh topology is in array Array{Faces{3,Int},1} containing a list of triangular faces which are defined by their vertices. Often in a numerical code one wants not only to iterate over faces or vertices, but also in case of singularity substraction, integration and local property estimation like normal vectors and curvature to know what are neighbouring verticies surrounding a given vertex while keeping track of orrientation of the normals. Also one wishes to modify the topology itself by colloapsing, flipingn and splitting edges. This is why different datstructrures are needed for different problems.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Intorduction","title":"Intorduction","text":"Fortunatelly it is possible to abstract queries of the topology through iterators:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Intorduction","title":"Intorduction","text":"Faces\nEdges","category":"page"},{"location":"#SurfaceTopology.Faces","page":"Intorduction","title":"SurfaceTopology.Faces","text":"Faces(t) returns an iterator for faces from representation of topology t\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#SurfaceTopology.Edges","page":"Intorduction","title":"SurfaceTopology.Edges","text":"Edges(t) returns an iterator for edges from representation of topology t\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#","page":"Intorduction","title":"Intorduction","text":"and circulators:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Intorduction","title":"Intorduction","text":"VertexRing\nEdgeRing","category":"page"},{"location":"#SurfaceTopology.VertexRing","page":"Intorduction","title":"SurfaceTopology.VertexRing","text":"VertexRing(v,t)\n\nConstruct a vertex ring iterator at vertex v from a given topology t. \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#SurfaceTopology.EdgeRing","page":"Intorduction","title":"SurfaceTopology.EdgeRing","text":"EdgeRing(v,t)\n\nConstruct an edge ring iterator at vertex v from a given topology t. \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#API-1","page":"Intorduction","title":"API","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Intorduction","title":"Intorduction","text":"At the moment the package implements three different kinds of datastructures.
