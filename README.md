A package for performing lookup queries for triangular meshes. As we know triangular meshes can be stored in a computer in a multiple different ways, each having strength and weaknesses in a particular cases. Not always it is clear which datastructure would be most performant for a numerical algorithm so it is wise to write a datastructure generic code. This package is exactly for that purpose.
